# rent4events

The project concerns the management of an event company which rents out its assortment and transports it to the place of special events. It is implemented in a two-person group, in which I deal with the frontend.

During the implementation I additionally use, among others: VueRouter, Vuex, Axios, Vuelidate Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

The project is in progress and for a detailed description I refer [here](http://www.klaudia-laskowska.pl/#/rent4events).
