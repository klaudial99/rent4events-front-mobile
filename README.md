# rent4events

The project concerns the management of an event company which rents out its assortment and transports it to the place of special events. It is implemented in a two-person group, in which I handled the frontend.

During the implementation I additionally used, among others: VueRouter, Vuex, Axios, Vuelidate, Bootstrap and Font Awesome.
